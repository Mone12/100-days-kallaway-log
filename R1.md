## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode 

### Day 0: Sep 7. Tuesday

**Thoughts:** My goal is to be skillful enough to take on a job as a data analyst but I'm not practicing enough as I should. My goal is to land a better job at least by the beginning of the new year if not the end of this one.

### Day 1: Sep. Wedensday

**Today's Progress**: Started off today practicing python through codeacademy. Right now I am brushing up on scoping.

**Thoughts:** Suprised at how much I still know. However, I know I still have much to learn in what feels like so little time. Would like to eventually start building app.
